**IBM CIC Baltic Smarter Office**

For lib management we started using [cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/)

    $ sudo gem install cocoapods

To install libs run these inside "native" folder:

    $ pod install

    $ open smarter-office.xcworkspace

We are currently using
[Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/ios-charts) 2.2.3
[Starscream](https://github.com/daltoniam/Starscream) 1.1.1 - websocket support
